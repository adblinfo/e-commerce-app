# E-Commerce Application
** e-commerce sample application using powered by Spring, Angular 4, MongoDB, Redis and more._**

This sample e-commerce application demonstrates how to build an application using microservices architecture paradigm with Polyglot Languages (Java, JavaScript) & Polyglot Persistance software (MongoDB, Redis). This sample application includes following functional microservices & infrastructure microservices. All of these microservices are independently deployable applications and are organized around business capabilities.

###Functional Microservices
* **Product Catalog Microservice**
* **Cart Microservice**

The application is setup as multi-level gradle project where each microservice is arranged as a sub-module under single parent project. It enables to run each microservice individually.

##Prerequisites
* **_MongoDB_** - Install MongoDB from(running on default port), https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
* **_Redis_** - Install Redis from(running on default port), https://redis.io/download
* **_JDK 8_** - Install JDK 1.8 version from, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* **_Gradle [Optional]_** - Download latest version of Gradle from https://gradle.org/gradle-download/ (binary distribution is good enough) and configure your machine with Gradle as specified at, https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html
* **_Node.js_** - Install Node.js from, https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* **_Angular 4_** - Install Angular 4 from, http://cli.angular.io

##Installation
#### Clone Repository
Clone respository source code by executing following instruction to any folder on your machine,
```
git clone https://github.com/damit619/e-commerce-app.git
cd e-commerce-app
```
###Building Application
#### Building Microservices
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/getting-started-gradle/) has been used as a build tool to build Spring Boot based Microservices applications. Issue following command on your terminal/console window,
```
gradlew clean build

cd product-catalog-service
gradlew bootRun

cd cart-service
gradlew bootRun
```
This command might take a while for first time as it needs to download serveral dependency libraries from Maven repository. This command will build & package all microservice applications.

#### Building Frontend App (Angular 4)
Frontend application is a Single Page Appliction built using Angular 4. The source code of this application is available under, '**_ecomm-webapp_**' folder. 
Issue following commands in sequence to build & run frontend app,
```
cd ecomm-webapp
npm install
ng serve
```
**Note**: 'npm install' command may take a while, as it needs to download all dependent npm modules used by frontend app.

Once above instructions successfully executed, you can view e-commerce application by browsing below URL,
